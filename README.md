# NC News Seeding

To use the database you will need to set up the environment variables.

2 files will need to be added, they will need to be .env. then the relevant file name as this will allow you to access our testing or development data.

Please kindly complete this task with the relevant name for the files depending on whether you need a test or a development file, an example would be **.env.test** or **.env.development** 

The clue to your set up is in the example.

Best of luck.

The project itself is a news application that would allow one to access certain endpoints to find articles, comments and users etc.

You would need to do npm install to install all of the relevant dependencies.
The code was done with Node v23.10.0 and Postgres psql (PostgreSQL) 14.17 (Homebrew).
