To use the database you will need to set up the environment variables.

2 files will need to be added, they will need to be .env. then the relevant file name as this will allow you to access our testing or development data.

Please kindly complete this task with the relevant name for the files depending on whether you need a test or a development file, an example would be **.env.test** or **.env.development**

Best of luck.
